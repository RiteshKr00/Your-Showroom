## Problems It Solves
In this pandemic, situation E-learning has proved a new and efficient method. For the past year, students are stuck in their homes and have attended numerous online classes. But online classes are monotonous and concepts taught are not retained by our minds. The situation becomes worse when a subject is mostly based on practicals because actually visualization is most important in such subjects as Aerospace, Biology, and many more. With this application, we focus to solve this problem. It utilizes 3D, Augmented reality to give, real-life simulations or feels of various models and make the learning process more impactful and interesting. With an interactive live feature, students can ask the teacher their doubts instantly and also can discuss among themselves.
